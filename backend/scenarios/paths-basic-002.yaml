  ## Objective

  Create an OpenAPI 3.0 specification that defines a POST endpoint for creating
  a new user resource.

  ## Requirements

  Your API specification must:

  1. Define a `POST` operation at the `/users` path
  2. Include a request body with `application/json` content type
  3. Mark the request body as required
  4. Return a `201` response for successful creation
  5. Include a description for the 201 response

  ## Tips

  - POST operations typically include a `requestBody` object
  - Use `required: true` on the requestBody to make it mandatory
  - Status code 201 is standard for successful resource creation

  - id: req-1
