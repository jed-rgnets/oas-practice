  ## Objective

  Create an OpenAPI 3.0 specification that defines a simple REST API endpoint
  for retrieving a list of users.

  ## Requirements

  Your API specification must:

  1. Define a `GET` operation at the `/users` path
  2. Return a `200` response for successful requests
  3. Specify `application/json` as the response content type
  4. Include a response description

  ## Tips

  - The `paths` object maps URL paths to path items
  - Each path item can contain operations (get, post, put, delete, etc.)
  - Responses are keyed by HTTP status code (as strings)
  - The `content` object maps media types to their schemas

requirements:
  - id: req-1
    description: "Define a GET operation at /users"
    hint: "Use the paths object with /users as a key, then add a get property"
    points: 3
  - id: req-2
    description: "Return a 200 response"
    hint: "Add a responses object under the get operation with '200' as a key"
    points: 3
  - id: req-3
    description: "Use application/json content type"
    hint: "Add content.application/json under the 200 response"
    points: 2
  - id: req-4
    description: "Include a response description"
    hint: "The description field is required for Response Objects"
    points: 2
